Description: Modified version of the Greybird theme with openSUSE branding elements.
 Greybird-Geeko is the default Xfce theme in openSUSE and is based on Greybird,
 which is the default theme in Xubuntu 11.04 onwards.

 The Shimmer Project are the designers and developers of both themes.

 Although originally created for Xfce, Greybird Geeko also supports other
 GTK+-based environments including Cinnamon, GNOME Shell, MATE, and Unity.
